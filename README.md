## Get Start

- Install Python>=3.8, PyTorch 1.8.1.
- Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/CHL-A1.sh
```

- Or you can train the model in Windows by:

```cmd
./scripts/CHL-A1.bat
```

- Or use `run.ipynb` in Colab to train the model.
